# Light-YOLOv5-A-Lightweight-Algorithm-for-Improved-YOLOv5-in-Complex-Fire-Scenarios
Fire-detection technology is of great importance for successful fire-prevention measures. Image-based fire detection is one effective method. At present, object-detection algorithms are deficient in performing detection speed and accuracy tasks when they are applied in complex fire scenarios. In this study, a lightweight fire-detection algorithm, Light-YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version five), is presented. First, a separable vision transformer (SepViT) block is used to replace several Cross Stage Partial Bottleneck with 3 convolutions (C3) modules in the final layer of a backbone network to enhance both the contact of the backbone network to global information and the extraction of flame and smoke features; second, a light bidirectional feature pyramid network (Light-BiFPN) is designed to lighten the model while improving the feature extraction and balancing speed and accuracy features during a fire-detection procedure; third, a global attention mechanism (GAM) is fused into the network to cause the model to focus more on the global dimensional features and further improve the detection accuracy of the model; and finally, the Mish activation function and SIoU loss are utilized to simultaneously increase the convergence speed and enhance the accuracy. The experimental results show that compared to the original algorithm, the mean average accuracy (mAP) of Light-YOLOv5 increases by 3.3%, the number of parameters decreases by 27.1%, and the floating point operations (FLOPs) decrease by 19.1%. The detection speed reaches 91.1 FPS, which can detect targets in complex fire scenarios in real time.
